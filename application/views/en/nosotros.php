		<h2>Our Team</h2>
		<p class="lead add_bottom_30">
Our ADVENTURE PARK PLAN began in 2011, when a group of friends and partners of the hotel industry of the Dominican Republic decided to analyze the menu of entertainment and adventure possibilities that are offered to visitors of the BÃ¡varo-Punta Cana zone, beyond the excellent all-inclusive packages offered by the hotels. We concluded that the offers were very limited and much could be offered. So the idea of an ADVENTURE PARK project was born. We wanted something different, challenging, exciting, ecologically friendly, and done to the highest world- wide standards possible for this type of project.
<p>Open air, nature-friendly, exciting and ecologically sustainable activities, challenging in accord with the physical capacities of our visitors, could offer the adventure and ADRENELINE RUSH for each individual in accord with their abilities and age range.</p>
